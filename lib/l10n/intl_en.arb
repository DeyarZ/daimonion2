Today is your day.||The best decisions are often the hardest.||A small progress is still progress.||The hardest decision of your life might be the one that changes everything.||Every great journey begins with a single step.||Those who underestimate you give you the greatest gift: the drive to prove them wrong.||Success is not a destination, but a journey – keep at it.||You can’t control anything except your reaction to the world.||The toughest moments often shape you the most.||What you plant today, you will harvest tomorrow.||If you fail, try again – but fail better next time.||Success means progress, not perfection.||Pain is temporary, pride lasts forever.||Focus beats chaos.||Do what needs to be done.||You’re a warrior – no excuse counts.||Hate fuels you, love makes you unstoppable.||Aim high – always.||Discipline is freedom.||Either you do it or someone else will.||Never lose faith in yourself.||Fear is your compass – follow it.",
